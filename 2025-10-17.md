<h1> MY Summer </h1>

<br>
A drop of sweat ran down my forehead. Lub-dub, lub-dub. My heart was racing, almost skipping a beat. My eyes moved around the room like I was trapped on a merry-go-round, except this wasn’t the fun kind you find at a fair. It felt more like being locked in an asylum with burning heat surrounding me. Every now and then, a small wave of cold air would brush against me, but it never lasted long. I was losing hope. I fell to my knees, searching the floor of my “prison” for what I was looking for when a small angel tapped my shoulder.

“Here you go, Miss Alex! I just wanted to take some pictures! Haha.”

The child held up my phone in her hand, wearing the most unapologetic smile ever. Her apology was terrible, but I still accepted it anyway. You’re probably wondering where I was, and honestly, I might have exaggerated my description a bit. I was at my summer job in Queens.

At the end of last school year, I really wanted to work again during the summer. I planned to get a simple job, make some money, buy myself new clothes, and go on a few shopping trips. I especially hoped to work with the Beam Center again through SYEP, and thankfully, I got accepted. I was super excited and ready to make that cash while gaining more experience. That excitement quickly shifted when I found out my work site was in Queens, which was much farther than I expected. My plan for an easy job suddenly turned into a long daily journey.

The only truly hard part of my summer job was the commute. Because I worked in Queens, I had to take the train almost every day, and it was always crowded. Sometimes I got lucky enough to find a seat, but most of the time I had to stand. Normally, I don’t mind long train rides, but the summer heat and constant delays made everything harder. Still, I pushed through and did my best to show up on time no matter how tired or overheated I was.

During the summer, I worked as a youth instructor for the Beam Center. I had completed the training a few months before, so I was prepared. A youth instructor is basically a student who helps teach kids how to do STEM and art projects. Most youth instructors could speak another language, preferably Spanish, since many of the students were bilingual or primarily Spanish-speaking. It wasn’t required, but it definitely helped. The group I worked with was a class of third graders moving into fourth grade. Some of them spoke English comfortably, but there were also a few who spoke only Spanish. I even met students who translated for their parents, which I thought was very sweet and mature of them.

Working with children was definitely an experience. They could argue over the smallest things and didn’t always know how to communicate properly, but I didn’t expect too much since they were still kids. It was funny to see what they would fight about, even though I had to stop them quickly before it got out of hand. There was one time, just like I mentioned in the beginning, when a student took my phone without me realizing it. I had left it on the teacher’s desk while helping the kids paint. When I returned, the class had gone on break, so I decided to clean up and play some music while waiting for them to come back. That’s when I realized my phone was gone. I searched everywhere, starting to panic, thinking I might have dropped it or lost it. When the kids returned, one of them tapped me on the shoulder and handed it back, saying she only wanted to take some pictures. I didn’t find the joke funny at all, but I smiled and told her not to do it again. The teacher gave her a light scolding, not harshly, but enough to get her attention. After that, she apologized, and I appreciated that.

I wasn’t allowed to discipline the kids myself since only the teacher could do that, but I always told the teacher whenever someone misbehaved. It made me feel a little powerless sometimes, but I understood that wasn’t part of my job. Still, I did my best to guide them and keep the classroom calm.

Working as a youth instructor completely changed the way I see teachers. I gained so much respect for them. Kids are not easy to handle, but their enthusiasm and curiosity make it all worth it. I loved the way their faces lit up when we learned something new, like when I taught them how to make a lightbulb or a fan. They would ask me questions like “How does it work?” and “How can I make mine better?” Seeing their excitement made me happy and reminded me of how much fun learning can be.

There was one student I’ll never forget. His name was Benedict, and he came in every morning with a big smile, asking me, “What are we learning today?” I always told him it was a secret and he’d find out soon. He was such a kind boy. There was also a girl in the class who was very homesick. She missed her mom a lot and looked sad most days. Benedict would always try to cheer her up and tell her, “Your mom would be mad if she saw you sulking.” It was funny but also very sweet, and it worked every time.

Near the end of the program, I used some of my own money to decorate the classroom for the final showcase day. The students got to show off all the projects they made during the summer. The whole class looked so proud, and I felt so proud of them too. At the same time, it made me sad that it was our last day together. After spending so much time with them, I realized how attached I had grown.

I also met a coworker named Brianna who became one of my closest friends. We shared our food during lunch breaks and talked about our experiences coming from Spanish-speaking countries. Brianna spoke mostly Spanish, while I spoke more English, but we taught each other words and phrases every day. It felt like our own little language class. It was funny when some of the students corrected my Spanish, but I didn’t mind because I learned a lot from them. My Spanish definitely improved that summer, and I became more confident speaking it.

When my job ended, I couldn’t believe how fast the summer went by. At the beginning, I thought the days would drag and that the long commute would make me miserable. But by the end, I realized I actually enjoyed going to work, and I missed it when it was over. It made me think about how I’ll probably feel at the end of high school. Right now, I can’t wait to graduate, but deep down, I know I’ll miss it when it’s over. I’ll miss my friends, my teachers, and the feeling of being in the same place every day, even if it’s stressful sometimes.

This job made me realize that endings aren’t always sad. They can also be a sign of growth and change. Just because something ends doesn’t mean it wasn’t meaningful. The memories and lessons you take with you matter more than how long it lasted. Even though my summer job is over, I’ll always remember those kids, their energy, and their laughter. Maybe one day, I’ll see them again, even if it’s just for a second on the train, and it’ll remind me of this experience.

My summer job was something I’ll never forget. It taught me patience, communication, and appreciation for both teachers and students. It wasn’t a vacation or a big adventure, but it was still one of the best experiences I’ve ever had. Even though I didn’t go anywhere fancy or close to home (I don’t like queens), I gained something more valuable, growth, memories, and friendships that will stay with me for a long time.

And that, my friends, was my summer. I didn’t go to any big events or take fancy trips, but I did go shopping once, mostly for food, and honestly, that was enough for me. Sometimes the best memories come from simple moments, and this summer definitely proved that.
