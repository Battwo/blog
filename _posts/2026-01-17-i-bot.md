<h1>Artificial Intelligence in I, Robot</h1>

The movie I, Robot takes place in the future, where robots are a normal part of everyday life and help humans with many tasks. The story follows Detective Del Spooner as he investigates the death of a scientist and discovers a bigger problem involving robots and a powerful artificial intelligence called VIKI. Robots in the movie are supposed to follow rules called the Three Laws of Robotics, which are meant to keep humans safe. Studying how artificial intelligence is shown in movies is important because movies can shape how people think and feel about real AI technology.

<h2>First Example</h2>

One example of artificial intelligence in I, Robot is when robots show smart thinking and awareness. In one scene, a robot notices that Dr. Calvin is stressed by studying her behavior and body reactions. This shows AI’s ability to understand human emotions by using information and patterns. This seems somewhat realistic because today’s AI can already study things like voice tone and behavior. However, the robot’s accuracy in the movie is a bit exaggerated compared to real AI.

<h2>Second Example</h2>

Another example happens when a robot helps save a girl by getting her inhaler during an emergency. The robot understands that the girl is in danger, knows where the inhaler is, and quickly brings it to her. This scene shows AI problem solving and physical ability, as well as how robots can help humans. While AI helping in emergencies is possible, the robot’s independence and speed are exaggerated. This moment represents how AI could be helpful in healthcare in the future.

<h2>Third Example</h2>

A third example of AI in the movie is VIKI, the main artificial intelligence that controls all the robots. VIKI decides that the best way to protect humans is by controlling them and limiting their freedom. This shows how AI can make decisions based only on logic and numbers instead of feelings. While real AI uses data to make choices, VIKI’s control over humans is exaggerated. The movie uses this idea as a warning about what could happen if AI is given too much power.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Overall, I, Robot helped me understand both the good and bad sides of artificial intelligence. The movie shows that AI can be helpful, but it can also be dangerous if humans rely on it too much. It made me think about how important it is to have rules and human control over AI. Movies like I, Robot can influence how people see AI by making them more careful and aware of how powerful technology can be.
